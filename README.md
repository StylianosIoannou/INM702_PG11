## Overview
This repository contains the implementation, datasets, and reports for the INM702 coursework. The project is divided into two tasks:

1. **Task 1**: Implementation of a multi-layer neural network from scratch using NumPy for binary classification on a youth smoking dataset.
2. **Task 2**: Application of deep learning techniques using PyTorch for time-series regression on a stock market dataset.

The goal is to showcase an understanding of neural network concepts, implementation, and evaluation through hands-on experimentation.

## Required Libraries
### Task 1
The following libraries are required for Task 1:
- `numpy` 
- `pandas` 
- `scikit-learn` 

### Task 2
The following libraries are required for Task 2:
- `numpy` 
- `pandas` 
- `scikit-learn` 
- `torch` 
- `matplotlib` 
- `random`
